/*
 * A long time ago, in a world far away, OpenSSL had a well-established mechanism for ensuring compatibility with
 * regards to added, changed, and removed functions, by having an SSLEAY_VERSION_NUMBER macro. This was then
 * renamed to OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER, but the old macro was kept around for compatibility until OpenSSL version
 * 1.1.0.
 *
 * Then the OpenBSD developers decided that having OpenSSL in their codebase was a bad idea. They forked it to
 * create LibreSSL, gutted all of the functionality they didn't want or need, and generally improved the library
 * a lot. Then, as the OpenBSD developers are want to do, they packaged up LibreSSL for release to other
 * operating systems, as LibreSSL Portable. Think along the lines of OpenSSH where they have also done this.
 *
 * The fun part of this story ends there. LibreSSL has an OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER macro, but they have set it to a
 * stupidly high value, version 2.0. OpenSSL version 2.0 does not exist, and LibreSSL 2.2 does not implement
 * everything OpenSSL 1.0.2 or 1.1.0 do. This completely breaks the entire purpose of the macro.
 *
 * The ifdef soup below is for LibreSSL compatibility. Please find whoever thought setting OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER
 * to a version that does not exist was a good idea. Encourage them to realise that it is not.   -- amdj
